# Bleskomat POS

The Bleskomat POS is an offline point-of-sale terminal device for the Bitcoin Lightning Network. This repository includes the open-source firmware, instructions how to build your own hardware device, and scripts to compile the firmware from source.

Main features include the following:
* Works offline - the device itself can work without an internet connection
* Localization to support mutliple languages - see `include/locale` directory for full list of supported languages
* Deep sleep mode of the ESP32 is used when device is battery-powered
* JSON-RPC API over serial (USB) allows configuration of device via browser using [BleskomatWebSerial](https://github.com/bleskomat/bleskomat-web-serial)

The Bleskomat POS must be paired with a server to facilitate Lightning Network payments on its behalf; see the options below:
* [Bleskomat Platform](https://platform.bleskomat.com) - non-custodial, requires a subscription
* [bleskomat-server](https://github.com/bleskomat/bleskomat-server) - non-custodial, open-source, self-hosted solution
* [lnbits](https://github.com/lnbits/lnbits-legend) via the LNURLDevice extension - open-source, self-hosted and possible to use custodial instances hosted by others; public instances of lnbits:
	* [legend.lnbits.com](https://legend.lnbits.com) - unstable, don't leave funds on this instance for very long

The rest of this document details the hardware and software requirements, how to build the hardware device, and instructions to compile firmware from source.

## Building the Hardware Device

Before proceeding, be sure that you have all the project's [hardware requirements](#hardware-requirements).

Step-by-step build process for the hardware device.


### Lilygo T-Display Kit

If using a battery, insert the battery's JST connector into the JST socket on the under-side of the T-Display devkit board. Insert the T-Display devkit board's pins into the keyboard module's sockets - they should line-up perfectly. The USB-C port should be pointing to the right.

![](docs/lilygo-tdisplay-home-screen.jpg)


### ESP32 Devkit

One breadboard is not large enough to accommodate all the pins of the ESP32 devkit due to the width of the devkit. This is why we recommend to connect two breadboards together.

Remove one of the power rails from one of the breadboards. Use the notches on the sides of the breadboards to connect them together length-wise.

Insert the ESP32 devkit into the pin holes of the new, combined breadboard.

![](docs/esp32devkit-build-breadboard-and-esp32-devkit.png)

Familiarize yourself with the ESP32 devkit's pinout reference below.

#### ESP32 devkit pinout

### Wiring the TFT Display

Insert the pins of the TFT display module into the breadboard where you have space available.

![](docs/esp32devkit-build-tft-display.png)

Use the table below to connect the ESP32 devkit to the TFT display module.

|  ESP32       | TFT         |
|--------------|-------------|
| VIN (V5)     | VCC         |
| GND          | GND         |
| GPIO22       | CS          |
| GPIO4        | RESET (RST) |
| GPIO2        | AO (RS)     |
| GPIO23       | SDA         |
| GPIO18       | SCK (CLK)   |
| 3V3          | LED (NC)    |

Notes on pin naming:
* There are boards where `GPIXXX` are marked as `GXX` instead of `DXX`.
* The `G23` may be there **twice** - the correct one is next to `GND`.
* Some boards have typos so a bit of guess-and-check is necessary sometimes.

![](docs/esp32devkit-build-tft-display-with-wires.png)

Refer to the [ESP32 devkit pinout](#esp32-devkit-pinout) for help identifying the pins on your ESP32.


### Wiring the Membrane Keypad

Use the table below to connect the ESP32 devkit to the 4x4 membrane keypad:

| ESP32       | Keypad   |
|-------------|----------|
| GPIO13      | R1       |
| GPIO14      | R2       |
| GPIO26      | R3       |
| GPIO25      | R4       |
| GPIO33      | C1       |
| GPIO32      | C2       |
| GPIO15      | C3       |
| GPIO21      | C4       |

![](docs/esp32devkit-build-membrane-keypad-4x4-with-wires.jpg)

Use the table below to connect the ESP32 devkit to the 4x3 membrane keypad:

| ESP32       | Keypad   |
|-------------|----------|
| GPIO13      | R1       |
| GPIO14      | R2       |
| GPIO26      | R3       |
| GPIO25      | C1       |
| GPIO33      | C2       |
| GPIO32      | C3       |

Refer to the [ESP32 devkit pinout](#esp32-devkit-pinout) for help identifying the pins on your ESP32.


## Installing Libraries and Dependencies

Before proceeding, be sure that you have all the project's [software requirements](#software-requirements).

Use make to install libraries and dependencies needed to build the firmware:
```bash
make install
```
* The firmware's dependencies are defined in its platformio.ini file located at `./platformio.ini`

If while developing you need to install a new library, use the following as a guide:
```bash
platformio lib install LIBRARY_NAME[@VERSION]
```
You can find PlatformIO's libraries repository [here](https://platformio.org/lib).


## Compiling and Uploading to Device

To compile the firmware (without uploading to a device):
```bash
make compile
```

To compile and upload to your device:
```bash
make upload DEVICE=/dev/ttyACM1
```
The device path for your operating system might be different. If you receive a "Permission denied" error about `/dev/ttyACM1` then you will need to set permissions for that file on your system:
```bash
sudo chown $USER:$USER /dev/ttyACM1
```

To open the serial monitor:
```bash
make monitor DEVICE=/dev/ttyACM1
```
Again the device path here could be different for your operating system.


## Generate Font Header Files

This project includes font header files in various sizes. These header files were generated using the fontconvert tool from [Adafruit-GFX-Library](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-GFX-Library). If you would like to use your own font, generate more font sizes of the existing fonts, or to expand the character set; you can use the following command as an example:
```bash
./scripts/generate-font-header-files.sh "./assets/fonts/Courier Prime Code/Courier Prime Code.ttf" 32-382 6,7,8,9,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,28
```
* `32-382` - this is the character range (e.g. first character = 32, last = 382). More characters = larger header files.
* `6,7,8,9,10,12,14,16,18,20,22,24,28` - comma-separated list of font sizes

Note that this requires the fontconvert tool to have been built locally. Use the following command to build it:
```bash
make fontconvert
```


## Configuring the Device

It is possible to configure the device via the following methods:
* [Browser-Based Configuration Tool](#browser-based-configuration-tool)
* [Command-Line Configuration Tool](#command-line-configuration-tool)
* [Hard-Coded Configuration](#hard-coded-configuration)


### List of Configuration Options

The following is a list of possible configuration options for the Bleskomat POS:
* `apiKey.key` - The API key secret that is used to generate cryptographic signatures and encrypted payloads.
* `apiKey.encoding` - The explicit encoding of the API key secret. This can be "hex", "base64", or empty-string (e.g "") to mean no encoding. When generating a new API key on the server, it will store the encoding along with the ID and secret.
* `callbackUrl` - The LNURL server base URL plus endpoint path. Example:
	* `https://p.bleskomat.com/pay/<apiKey.id>`
* `uriSchemaPrefix` - The URI schema prefix for LNURLs generated by the device. It has been discovered that some wallet apps mistakenly only support lowercase URI schema prefixes. Uppercase is better because when encoded as a QR code, the generated image is less complex and so easier to scan. Set this config to empty-string (e.g `uriSchemaPrefix=`) to not prepend any URI schema prefix.
* `fiatCurrency` - The fiat currency symbol for which the device is configured; see [ISO 4217](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_4217).
* `fiatPrecision` - The number of digits to the right of the decimal point when rendering fiat currency amounts.
* `keypadRowPins` - Comma-separated list of GPIO numbers for the keypad's row pins.
* `keypadColPins` - Comma-separated list of GPIO numbers for the keypad's column pins.
* `keypadCharList` - The keypad character list read left-to-right, top-to-bottom. Examples:
	* T-Display Keyboard = `"123456789*0#"`
	* Membrane Keypad (4x3) = `"123456789*0#"`
	* Membrane Keypad (4x4) = `"123A456B789C*0#D"`
* `locale` - The locale used when rendering text to the screen. See the `./include/locale` directory for the full list of supported languages.
* `sleepModeDelay` - Number of milliseconds of inactivity to wait before the device will enter power-saving mode.
* `contrastLevel` - The contrast level between text and background colors. If the ambient light level is low, decreasing the contrast can improve scannability of QR codes.
* `tftRotation` The orientation of the TFT display. This is useful to allow different positions of the display. The possible rotation values are:
	* 0 = 0 degrees
	* 1 = 90 degrees
	* 2 = 180 degrees
	* 3 = 270 degrees
	* 3 = 270 degrees
* `logLevel` - Possible values:
	* `trace` - everything
	* `debug`
	* `info` - default
	* `warn`
	* `error`
	* `none` - nothing


### Browser-Based Configuration Tool

The Bleskomat Platform provides a [browser-based configuration tool](https://platform.bleskomat.com/serial) to upload pre-built device firmware, view real-time log output, update device configurations, run JSON-RPC serial commands, and more.


### Command-Line Configuration Tool

It is also possible to use the [bleskomat-cli](https://github.com/bleskomat/bleskomat-cli) command-line utility to communicate with a Bleskomat hardware device via JSON-RPC over serial API. Please refer to that project's readme for installation and usage information.


### Hard-Coded Configuration

Hard-coded configurations can be set by modifying the source file [config.cpp](https://github.com/bleskomat/bleskomat-pos/blob/master/src/config.cpp#L128).

Each time you make changes to the hard-coded configurations, you will need to re-compile and flash the ESP32's firmware.
